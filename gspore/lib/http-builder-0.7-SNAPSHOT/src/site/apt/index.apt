* 16 Oct 2012 - 0.6.0 released, source now hosted on Github

  The 0.6.0 release is now available which takes care of upgrading some older dependencies.

  The source code is now {{{https://github.com/jgritman/httpbuilder}hosted on Github}}

* 26 Dec 2011 - 0.5.2 finally finally released for reals

  With so many other projects, HTTPBuilder has taken a back seat, to say the least.
  Well, I've finally made 0.5.2 official, so folks relying on snapshots can now
  use a release version.  I hope to turn around 0.5.3 quickly to address a couple
  important issues like the Groovy range dependency, SSL host verification,
  preemptive auth and maybe whitespace URI parameter encoding.

  Stay tuned and watch for snapshots!

* 30 Sept 2010 - 0.5.1 with OAuth Support!

  I've been meaning to implement this for a while now, especially since Twitter
  made the switch, and I use the Twitter API for a lot of unit tests.  Now,
  {{{http://oauth.net}OAuth}} is supported in HTTPBuilder 0.5.1 thanks to the
  {{{http://code.google.com/p/oauth-signpost/}Signpost framework}}.  The
  implementation isn't perfect due to
  {{{http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-901}a limitation}} in
  HttpClient 4.0.  However, once HttpClient 4.1 is released, I expect to update
  the implementation which should be transparent to most users.

  I did my best to ensure this release is binary compatible with version 0.5.0.
  While 0.5.1 has an <optional> dependency on Signpost, if you are not using
  OAuth to sign your requests, you should not need the Signpost JARs on your
  classpath.  No Signpost classes are loaded until you indicate that you want to
  OAuth sign your requests.

  Want to see the API changes?
  <<<{{{./apidocs/groovyx/net/http/AuthConfig.html#oauth(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)}HTTPBuilder.auth.oauth()}}>>>
  and
  <<<{{{./apidocs/groovyx/net/http/HttpURLClient.html#setOAuth(java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.Object,%20java.lang.Object)}HttpURLClient.setOAuth()}}>>>.

* 3 May 2010 - 0.5.0 Released (finally!)

  I've pushed 0.5.0 out the door!  It's the same as RC3, so if you've been using
  that you should be able to just change the version number and you're good to
  go.  I'm already working on some minor improvements for a minor release (0.5.1)
  but they didn't merit being squeezed into the 0.5.0 release since it's already
  been delayed so long.  Enjoy!

* 31 Mar 2010 - Problems with Grape/ Grab

  So I had a couple people mention that they had trouble using <<<Grape>>> to
  download RC3 due to a bad checksum on the POM file.  I tried re-deploying it,
  (thinking it was a bad upload) and now I'm getting a _bunch_ of people saying
  they can't download it!

  As a work-around, please add the following line to <<<~/.groovy/grapeConfig.xml>>>:
  <<<<property name="ivy.checksums" value=""/>>>>.  This should allow Grape to
  ignore the checksum and download the file, until I've got the checksum problem
  resolved.  Stay tuned!

* 17 Feb 2010 - 0.5.0-RC3 Released

  I've been extremely lax in getting 0.5.0 out the door, but a couple minor
  bugs have been uncovered in the mean time.  All known defects are fixed at
  this point, and I'm planning on releasing 0.5.0 final in the next week or so,
  provided no new defects are uncovered!

  Please test out RC3 and stay tuned!

* 16 Oct 2009 - Added Ohloh Stats

  So I added this project to Ohloh, which found HTTPBuilder to be "Extremely
  well commented," :) but also a "small development team." :(  The stats are a
  little off too, since it has included the HTML and XHTML DTDs which are in
  source control, but I obviously did not write them...

  On a related note, if the Ohloh animated GIF on the sidebar
  particularly annoys anyone, just complain and I can remove it.  Although I do
  like how it brags about the project :)


* 06 Oct 2009 - More Snapshots & important changes...

  So no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to release 0.5.0.  More accurately,
  a few important issues came up that I didn't want to fix in a 0.6 branch
  immediately after a 0.5.0 release.  So my solution instead is to introduce some
  late changes...

  Probably the most important change is URIBuilder's handling of query parameters.
  Previously, URIBuilder only allowed a single value per-parameter.  That is,
  it was impossible to do <<<?one=1&two=2&one=3>>> because the Map literal does
  not allow duplicate keys.  Well, now you can pass a list of values like so:
  <<<uri.query = [ one: ['1','3'] , two: 2 ]>>> which will add two values for
  <<<one>>>.  Of course, this behavior merits a change to the <<<addQueryParam>>>
  method as well.

  As a result, <<<URIBuilder.addQueryParam>>> and <<<addQueryParams>>>
  will not replace any existing parameters with the same name; instead it will
  add to a multi-valued list for the given parameter.  Parameters with single
  values will remain as strings, not lists.

* 16 June 2009 - 0.5.0 RC1!

  RC1 is released!  Go {{{./download.html}download it}}!

  Keep in mind there are a few breaking changes from 0.4.1.  See the
  {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GMOD/fixforversion/15065}JIRA report}}
  for a full list of changes.  Some breaking changes include:

  [[]] New Maven group - <<<org.codehaus.groovy.modules.http-builder>>>

  [[]] HTTPBuilder.(get|post) named arguments - <<<params>>> is now <<<query>>>

  [[]] The HTTPBuilder class' <<<URL>>> property has been renamed to <<<uri>>>

    []

  Of course the 0.5.0 release has a ton of more <interesting> changes; read below
  for most of them...


* 13 June 2009 - Release Candidate (almost...)

  I was just about to release version 0.5.0-RC1 and announce it on the mailing
  list, when suddenly my unit tests started failing!  <<<HTTP response code: 503
  - http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd>>> ...  What?
  Turns out, I got bit by the {{{http://www.w3.org/blog/systeam/2008/02/08/w3c_s_excessive_dtd_traffic}
  W3C trying frantically to conserve their bandwidth}}.

  So realizing this is something that should really be built in, I added the capability via Apache's {{{http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/}
  XML Resolver}}.  All HTML4 and XHTML DTDs are now cached in a
  {{{http://fisheye.codehaus.org/browse/gmod/httpbuilder/trunk/src/main/resources/catalog/html.xml?r=root:}
  default catalog}}, so parsing any sites that reference those DTDs should see a
  significant performance improvement now.



* 29 May 2009

  The 0.5.0 release is almost feature complete; see
  {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GMOD/fixforversion/15065}JIRA}} for a list
  of issues that have been gone into this version.  One of the major changes in
  today's snaphot release is deprecation of the 'params' named parameter.

  For HTTPBuilder operations that take name parameters, <<<params>>> has been
  replaced by <<<query>>> to set URL query parameters.  This is to more clearly
  differentiate between URL and form POST parameters, and to avoid possible
  collision with future convenience methods for Apache HttpClient 'params'
  configuration.

  Please test out the latest snapshot; if I don't hear any bug reports in a week
  or two, I'll release v0.5.0.

* 27 Apr 2009

  <<Note to Maven users:>>  The project's group ID has changed to conform with
  the standard for Groovy projects hosted on Codehaus.  The new group ID is
  <<org.codehaus.groovy.modules.http-builder>>.

  The 0.5 release is still pending, but I have an exciting new feature -
  <<HttpURLClient>>.  This may seem redundant, since its features are almost
  identical to HTTPBuilder and RESTClient.  The kicker though is that this class
  works with Google App Engine!

  GAE's Java sandbox doesn't allow socket usage, which totally kills Apache
  HttpClient (and hence, HB).  This class uses HttpURLConnection for all I/O,
  enabling most of the conveniences of HTTPBuilder within GAE.  Try it out
  in the latest HTTPBuilder snapshot.

* 30 Mar 2009

  Documentation is in the process of being overhauled to provide more
  comprehensive API examples.  I've published a version that is still in
  progress, but certainly better than the single document that I had previously.

* 11 Mar 2009

  The latest 0.5 version now includes a new RESTClient class for even easier
  REST-style operations without a user-defined closure!  See
  {{{http://fisheye.codehaus.org/browse/gmod/httpbuilder/trunk/src/main/script/twitter_restbuilder.groovy?r=root:}
  the Twitter example}}, and the updated {{{./apidocs/groovyx/net/http/RESTClient.html}JavaDoc}}.

* 04 Mar 2009

  Now you can follow us on {{{http://twitter.com/httpbuilder}Twitter!}}
  HTTPBuilder now 'tweets' its releases as an automated part of the build
  process.  This is a neat proof-of-concept that could easily be added to any
  Maven build thanks to
  {{{http://groovy.codehaus.org/GMaven+-+Executing+Groovy+Code#GMaven-ExecutingGroovyCode-ExecuteaLocalGroovyScript}GMaven.}}
  See the
  {{{http://fisheye.codehaus.org/browse/gmod/httpbuilder/trunk/pom.xml?r=root:#l122}POM}}
   and
  {{{http://fisheye.codehaus.org/browse/gmod/httpbuilder/trunk/src/main/script/release_tweet.groovy?r=root:}tweet script}}
   for details.
