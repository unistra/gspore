SSL Configuration

  SSL should, for the most part, "just work."  There are a few situations where
  it is not completely intuitive.  You can follow the example below, or see HttpClient's
  {{{http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/SSLSocketFactory.html}SSLSocketFactory documentation}}
  for more information.


* SSLPeerUnverifiedException

  If you can't connect to an SSL website, it is likely because the certificate
  chain is not trusted.  This is an Apache HttpClient issue, but explained here
  for convenience.  To correct the untrusted certificate, you need to import a
  certificate into an SSL truststore.

  First, export a certificate from the website using your browser.  For example,
  if you go to <https://dev.java.net> in Firefox, you will probably get a warning
  in your browser.  Choose "Add Exception," "Get Certificate," "View,"
  "Details tab." Choose a certificate in the chain and export it as a PEM file.
  You can view the details of the exported certificate like so:

-----------------------
$ keytool -printcert -file EquifaxSecureGlobaleBusinessCA-1.crt
Owner: CN=Equifax Secure Global eBusiness CA-1, O=Equifax Secure Inc., C=US
Issuer: CN=Equifax Secure Global eBusiness CA-1, O=Equifax Secure Inc., C=US
Serial number: 1
Valid from: Mon Jun 21 00:00:00 EDT 1999 until: Sun Jun 21 00:00:00 EDT 2020
Certificate fingerprints:
         MD5:  8F:5D:77:06:27:C4:98:3C:5B:93:78:E7:D7:7D:9B:CC
         SHA1: 7E:78:4A:10:1C:82:65:CC:2D:E1:F1:6D:47:B4:40:CA:D9:0A:19:45
         Signature algorithm name: MD5withRSA
         Version: 3
....
-----------------------

  Now, import that into a Java keystore file:

-----------------------
$ keytool -importcert -alias "equifax-ca" -file EquifaxSecureGlobaleBusinessCA-1.crt \
> -keystore truststore.jks -storepass test1234
Owner: CN=Equifax Secure Global eBusiness CA-1, O=Equifax Secure Inc., C=US
Issuer: CN=Equifax Secure Global eBusiness CA-1, O=Equifax Secure Inc., C=US
Serial number: 1
Valid from: Mon Jun 21 00:00:00 EDT 1999 until: Sun Jun 21 00:00:00 EDT 2020
Certificate fingerprints:
         MD5:  8F:5D:77:06:27:C4:98:3C:5B:93:78:E7:D7:7D:9B:CC
         SHA1: 7E:78:4A:10:1C:82:65:CC:2D:E1:F1:6D:47:B4:40:CA:D9:0A:19:45
         Signature algorithm name: MD5withRSA
         Version: 3
...
Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
Certificate was added to keystore
-----------------------

  Now you want to use this truststore in your client:
