AsyncHTTPBuilder

  AsyncHTTPBuilder is very similar to HTTPBuilder, except that all requests are
  delegated to a thread pool and executed asynchronously.  Requests return a
  {{{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?java/util/concurrent/Future.html}java.util.concurrent.Future}}
   instance, which can be used to access the response data once it has completed.

  In practice, it is very similar to the Ajax.Request class in Prototype.js.

  This class also demonstrates the ease of which HTTPBuilder can be extended.
  The <<<doRequest()>>> method was simply overridden in order to execute requests
  from a <<<ThreadPoolExecutor>>>.  You can see the full source code
  {{{../xref/groovyx/net/http/AsyncHTTPBuilder.html}here}}.
