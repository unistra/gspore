  The {{{../apidocs/groovyx/net/http/URIBuilder.html}URIBuilder}} class is
  extremely useful for URI and URL construction and manipulation.  It is used
  within HTTPBuilder, but it is also useful even from plain Java code.

  If you've ever attempted to change a URL relative to its current path,
  you've probably noticed that using <<<URI.resolvePath(..)>>> strips off everything
  after the last '/' of the URI, including any 'document,' query string and
  fragment.  URIBuilder aims to make URI manipulation a <lot> easier and
  allows you to manipulate aspects of the URL while maintaining the other pieces:


%{code-snippet|id=uri1|brush=groovy|file=src/site/examples.txt}


  Query parameters can also be easily manipulated as a map:

%{code-snippet|id=uri2|brush=groovy|file=src/site/examples.txt}


  As mentioned above, URIBuilder is also useful from Java.  This is because
  URIBuilder's setter methods return the modified builder instance, to allow
  for the 'fluent interface' pattern.  The above example could be written
  in Java as follows:

%{code-snippet|id=uri3|brush=groovy|file=src/site/examples.txt}

  URIBuilder also has methods for coercion to a URI or URL instance.  Since
  URIBuilder is mutable, it generally should <<not>> be used for things like
  map keys.  In this case, the builder's current state should be frozen by
  coercing it to a URI or URL.
