HttpURLClient

  HTTPURLClient is an alternate implementation that does not rely on HttpClient
  sockets for communication.  The main motivation behind this is use in
  {{{http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/overview.html}Google App Engine}}.
  GAE does not allow direct socket communication; instead web resources
  are accessed only via the <<<HttpURLConnection>>> class.  Since
  <<<HttpURLConnection>>> is somewhat cumbersome to use (particularly for REST
  operations,) <<<HttpURLClient>>> applies some of HTTPBuilder's idioms on top
  of an HttpURLConnection.

  HttpURLClient supports automatic content-type parsing and request marshalling,
  URI manipulation and the convenient header access.

  Here is an example of accessing
  {{{http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-API-Documentation}Twitter's REST interface}},
  using both XML and JSON:

  Note that the example above can be run by adding the <<<@Grab>>> macro with
  Groovy 1.6+ to automatically download the HTTPBuilder libraries.  See the
  {{{../download.html}download page}} for more details.
